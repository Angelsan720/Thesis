The method has the merit of capturing the dynamics of mortality change by a single time index that is almost invariably linear. This thirtieth anniversary review of its 1992 publication examines the LC method and the large body of research that it has since spawned. We first describe the method and present a 30-year ex post evaluation of the original LC forecast for U.S. mortality. We then review the most prominent extensions of the LC method in relation to the limitations that they sought to address. With a focus on the efficacy of the various extensions, we review existing evaluations and comparisons. To conclude, we juxtapose the two main statistical approaches used, discuss further issues, and identify several potential avenues for future research.}

              patterns of mortality decline for long-term projections",
  author   = "Li, Nan and Lee, Ronald and Gerland, Patrick",
  abstract = "In developed countries, mortality decline is decelerating at
              younger ages and accelerating at old ages, a phenomenon we call
              ``rotation.'' We expect that this rotation will also occur in
              developing countries as they attain high life expectancies. But
              the rotation is subtle and has proved difficult to handle in
              mortality models that include all age groups. Without taking it
              into account, however, long-term mortality projections will
              produce questionable results. We simplify the problem by focusing
              on the relative magnitude of death rates at two ages (0 and
              15-19) while making assumptions about changes in rates of decline
              at other ages. We extend the Lee-Carter method to incorporate
              this subtle rotation in projection. We suggest that the extended
              Lee-Carter method could provide plausible projections of the age
              pattern of mortality for populations, including those that
              currently have very high life expectancies. Detailed examples are

  author   = "Mubarik, Sumaira and Wang, Fang and Luo, Lisha and Hezam, Kamal
              and Yu, Chuanhua",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Precise breast cancer-related mortality forecasts are
              required for public health program and healthcare service
              planning. A number of stochastic model-based approaches for
              predicting mortality have been developed. The trends shown by
              mortality data from various diseases and countries are critical
              to the effectiveness of these models. This study illustrates the
              unconventional statistical method for estimating and predicting
              the mortality risk between the early-onset and
              screen-age/late-onset breast cancer population in China and
              Pakistan using the Lee-Carter model. METHODS: Longitudinal death
              data for female breast cancer from 1990 to 2019 obtained from the
              Global Burden of Disease study database were used to compare
              statistical approach between early-onset (age group, 25-49 years)
              and screen-age/late-onset (age group, 50-84 years) population. We
              evaluated the model performance both within (training period,
              1990-2010) and outside (test period, 2011-2019) data forecast
              accuracy using the different error measures and graphical
              analysis. Finally, using the Lee-Carter model, we predicted the
              general index for the time period (2011 to 2030) and derived
              corresponding life expectancy at birth for the female breast
              cancer population using life tables. RESULTS: Study findings
              revealed that the Lee-Carter approach to predict breast cancer
              mortality rate outperformed in the screen-age/late-onset compared
              with that in the early-onset population in terms of goodness of
              fit and within and outside forecast accuracy check. Moreover, the
              trend in forecast error was decreasing gradually in the
              screen-age/late-onset compared with that in the early-onset
              breast cancer population in China and Pakistan. Furthermore, we
              observed that this approach had provided almost comparable
              results between the early-onset and screen-age/late-onset
              population in forecast accuracy for more varying mortality
              behavior over time like in Pakistan. Both the early-onset and
              screen-age/late-onset populations in Pakistan were expected to
              have an increase in breast cancer mortality by 2030. whereas, for
              China, it was expected to decrease in the early-onset population.
              CONCLUSION: The Lee-Carter model can be used to estimate breast
              cancer mortality and so to project future life expectancy at
              birth, especially in the screen-age/late-onset population. As a
              result, it is suggested that this approach may be useful and
              convenient for predicting cancer-related mortality even when
              epidemiological and demographic disease data sets are limited.
              According to model predictions for breast cancer mortality,
              improved health facilities for disease diagnosis, control, and
              prevention are required to reduce the disease's future burden,
              particularly in less developed countries.",

              the straightforward interpretation of the model parameters. This
              model assumes an invariant age component and linear time
              component for forecasting. We apply the Lee-Carter method on
              smoothed mortality rates obtained by LASSO-type regularization
              and hence adjust the time component with the observed lifespan
              disparity. Smoothing with LASSO produces less error during the
              fitting period than do spline-based smoothing techniques. As a
              more informative indicator of longevity, matching with lifespan
              disparity makes the time component more reflective of mortality
              improvements. The forecasts produced by the new method were more
              accurate during out-of-sample evaluation and provided optimistic
              forecasts for many low-mortality countries.",

   abstract = {<p>A three‐component, competing‐risk mortality model, developed for animal survival data, fits human life table data for all ages over a range of mean life spans from 16 to 74 years. The competing risks are a novel exponentially‐decreasing hazard, dominant during immaturity; a constant hazard, dominant during adulthood; and an exponentially increasing Gompertzian hazard, dominant during senescence. By fitting the model to a specific life table using non‐linear techniques, estimates of the five model parameters and their standard errors obtain; the proportion of deaths expected from each hazard alone may then be calculated. Preliminary analysis of 13 life tables indicates that for human populations under heavy stress, with very short mean life spans of about 20 years, the three hazard components account for roughly equal numbers of deaths; for modern populations, with mean life spans of about 75 years, nearly all deaths are due to the hazard of senescence. Factor analysis of the correlation matrix of parameter values for the 13 populations shows a two‐factor structure. One factor involves only the multiplicative constants (initial values) of the three hazards, but not the hazard rates of change; the second factor involves only the parameters of the immaturity hazard and the rate of acceleration of the senescence hazard, but not the constant hazard nor the multiplicative constant (initial value) of the senescence hazard.</p>},

	abstract = {Background: The risk of cancer among Hispanics with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ({AIDS}) in the United States and Puerto Rico ({PR}) has not been well described. The purpose of this study was to determine the risk of {AIDS} related and non-{AIDS} related cancers among Hispanics with {AIDS} in {PR}. Methods: A probabilistic record linkage of the {PR} {AIDS} Surveillance Program and {PR} Central Cancer Registry databases was conducted. {AIDS} cases were grouped according to year of {AIDS} onset and antiretroviral therapy availability: 1987-1989 (limited availability), 1990-1995 (mono and dual therapy), and 1996-2003 (highly active antiretroviral therapy: {HAART}). Cancer risk was described using the standardized incidence ratios ({SIR}). Results: A total of 612 cancers were identified after 3 months of {AIDS} diagnosis: 409 (66.7\%) {AIDS} related and 203 (33.1\%) non-{AIDS} related. Although a decreasing trend in the risk of {AIDS} and non-{AIDS} related cancers was observed, the risk for both remained higher in the {AIDS} group compared to the general population in {PR}. Non-{AIDS} related cancers with higher risk during the {HAART} availability were: oropharyngeal, anal, liver, larynx, eye and orbit, Hodgkin lymphoma, and vaginal. Conclusion: Hispanics with {AIDS} in {PR} consistently showed a greater risk of {AIDS} and non-{AIDS} related cancers compared to the general population in {PR} and that has not changed over time.},

Examination of 9,814 Puerto Rican urban and rural men in the 45 to 64-year age group revealed sizable and statistically significant differences in monthly income, cigarette smoking, ingestion of fats, blood pressure, heart rate, relative weight, serum cholesterol, serum glycerides, prevalence of diabetes, and prevalence of hypertension (lower in rural dwellers), and also in vital capacity, consumption of calories per unit body weight, and physical activity (higher in rural area). No urban-rural difference in coronary heart disease prevalence was found, but the prevalence of definite myocardial infarction, established on basis of electrocardiographic criteria alone, was significantly higher in the 45 to 54-year urban group. Follow-up of this population to study incidence of disease and the influence of the various factors upon the development of disease is being conducted.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
